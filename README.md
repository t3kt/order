## system structure
Order is composed of several subsystems:
* input and control systems
  * input handling - routes MIDI and Leap Motion input to system parameters
  * control UI - control panel UI for viewing and editing parameters
  * audio I/O
  * audio analysis and routing
  * timing
* geometry systems
  * generators
  * pre-theshold distortion
  * threshold
  * post-theshold distortion
* rendering
* post-processing
